I have been heavily involved with Human Powered Vehicle (HPV) design, construction and racing in different forms since year 10 in high school.

I was a member of the [Kingswood College Human Powered Vehicle (HPV) racing team](https://www.youtube.com/@kingswoodevoracing66) for three years from 2017 to 2019. We competed in three races each year, culminating in the Energy Breakthrough held in Maryborough. This contains a 24 hour endurance race where a team of eight riders complete as many laps as possible on a track with often over 100 vehicles on it.

Soon after starting university, I joined [Monash Human Power (MHP)](https://monashhumanpower.org/) as a member of the hardware electrical subteam.
