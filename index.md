I am currently in my final year of completing a double degree in Electrical and Computer Systems Engineering (ECSE) and Science with an extended major in Computational Science at Monash University.

Soon after starting university, I joined [Monash Human Power (MHP)](https://monashhumanpower.org/) as a member of the hardware electrical subteam. I am currently the hardware electrical subteam lead.

Below are a few engineering related projects and experiences that I have been involved in.
