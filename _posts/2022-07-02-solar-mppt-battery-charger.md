This project was to build a battery charger to stop my Grandparent's tractor's battery from going flat over the winter when it was not in use. The charger's main claim to fame is that it is designed to charge batteries from solar panels that provide a lower voltage output than the battery requires. The charger currently provides power for a solar powered electric fence.
