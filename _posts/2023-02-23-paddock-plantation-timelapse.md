Back in July 2020, I set up an old phone and an assortment of other parts in a
new tree plantation to watch the trees (and grass) grow. Over the following
three years it has taken well over 130,000 photos.

Selected photographs have been combined into High Dynamic Range (HDR) images and
these used as frames to create a video. The most up to date video that I have
uploaded can be found [here](/PaddockPlantationTimelapse.html).

I find it fairly fascinating to watch the trees shoot up out of nowhere and the
grass change colour and grow with the seasons, before disappearing again as it
is mown (generally takes a couple of watches to spot many details).
