An Arduino library to decode and play simple tunes. This library was written for
use in the [musical bicycle siren]({% link _posts/2022-02-01-bike-horn.md %}) and has since been used in other projects as
well. It is inspired by the tune command from PICAXE microcontrollers, however
has more functionality and uses a different encoding scheme.

I also wrote a plugin for [Musescore](musescore.org) to convert suitable sheet music into a suitable format automatically.
