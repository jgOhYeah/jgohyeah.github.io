In 2024, I completed the final year project (FYP) for my degree, working with Oscar Varney to develop a power meter and crank-set for Human Powered Vehicles (HPVs).

The crank-set is the spinning device that connects the pedals (and riderâ€™s legs) to the chain and rest of the drive-train. This crank-set is optimised for the unique geometry requirements of high performance HPVs and uses inbuilt strain gauges to measure torque and an accelerometer and gyroscope to measure the angular velocity of the cranks. A microcontroller processes and multiplies these values to calculate the instantaneous and average power produced by the rider. The entire system is powered from a battery located in the middle of the axle.

MQTT messages sent over Wi-Fi and Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) are used to offload the data to customised data-logging systems or off the shelf bicycle computers.

The PCB design files and firmware have been made open source and are available on GitHub.
